# RR Carousel


Hello Mykel.

I prepared 2 zip files (see them on Google drive link) in order to download the carousel slides template.
 [Download Zip files on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1LWw35hCjaIo92FhQsSLBOAAKJcoFAvTx)

When we create the slides for the carousel I strongly suggest to use them to make easier to finish them.
The difference in between these similar slides are.


### multi-click-area.zip
This one for slides that have more than 1 link. Just the desktop version use `<area>` Tag. And it only will work for desktop and will not work on mobile because phones have different sizes.

### uni-click-area.zip
This one is for Slides that has just one link.

Following these templates to build up the templates could help to avoid big adjustments on the carousel once the work is done.
