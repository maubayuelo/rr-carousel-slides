# RR Carousel


Hello Mykel.

I prepared 2 zip files (see them on Google drive link) in order to download the carousel slides template.

When we create the slides for the carousel I strongly suggest to use them to make easier to finish them.
The difference in between these similar slides are.

### uni-click-area.zip
This one is for Slides that has just one link.

### multi-click-area.zip
This one for slides that have more than 1 link.

Following these templates to build up the templates could help to avoid big adjustments on the carousel once the work is done.
